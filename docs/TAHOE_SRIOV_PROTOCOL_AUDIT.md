# Tahoe SR-IOV protocol audit — in progress

Updated: 2026-09-26. Source baseline: `1dd2f4b` on
`codex/tahoe-sriov-vf`. This safety-audit checkpoint is untested on hardware
and is NOT a boot-test candidate or successful driver baseline.
Checkpoint `4a0b838` passed native macOS build/link and sanitizer CI:
https://github.com/umeow0716/NootedGreen/actions/runs/36215000826 .
The reported whole-host freeze has NOT been assigned a proven cause.
Keep `macos-tahoe-sriov` shut off during this review.

## Evidence inspected

- Local i915 source: `/usr/src/i915-sriov-dkms-2026.03.05.7`.
- Apple binary: `build/test-kexts/v213/AppleIntelTGLGraphics.kext/Contents/MacOS/AppleIntelTGLGraphics`
  under the parent workspace.
- `IGHardwareGuCCTBuffer::initWithAccelerator`, address `0x1f386`:
  stores `IGSharedMappedBuffer::withOptions` result at object offset `0x40`.
- `IGHardwareGuCCTBuffer::free`, address `0x1f564`:
  releases that object at `0x1f5a3`; it also accesses physical `0xcee8`.
  Offsets `0x18` and `0x20` are queue locks, NOT backing objects.
- `gt/iov/intel_iov_memirq.c` allocates and pins a separate memory-IRQ
  object, programs its addresses separately, and releases it in IOV teardown.
  Our bridge instead shares its allocation with CTB. CTB disable alone
  therefore does not establish a safe lifetime boundary for that allocation.

## Working changes

- Replace the physical interrupt filter on VF and consume memory IRQs;
  bound G2H draining and stop submissions on detected protocol faults.
- Track asynchronous context enable/disable/deregister events and retain
  context backing while firmware ownership is uncertain.
- Replace physical GuC TLB invalidation with modern GuC actions and remove
  legacy binary `0xcee8` accesses only on an identified VF.
- Exclude VF from physical engine setup, reset-list population, watchdog
  register reads and Blit3D tier-1/error-register diagnostics.
- Reject scheduler preferences other than reference GuC scheduler 4 on an
  already initialized VF.
- Retain CTB backing during channel layout, before publishing it. Reject subsequent
  initialization while it remains retained. Failed transport disable must
  propagate failure on the second legacy channel teardown as well.
- Keep the shared CTB/memory-IRQ backing retained even after successful CTB
  disable. This is an intentional temporary leak, not a completed teardown
  implementation. Device restart/reinitialization is currently unsupported.
- Mark undersized known GuC lifecycle completions as protocol faults.

## Required follow-up before any boot test

1. Complete the device-identity audit. VF_CAP identification is now independent
   of bootstrap; start, MMIO, interrupt and TLB routes fail closed rather than
   treating failed VF initialization as a PF. Remaining readiness/CPU-based
   branches still require review. PCI capability gating was added below.
2. Prove complete teardown ordering: prevent new senders, synchronize running
   interrupt handlers, stop engine and GuC memory-IRQ writes, then release
   mappings and backing. Retaining an OSObject alone is not proof that explicit
   unmap/ownership-transfer paths cannot invalidate its GPU mapping.
3. Audit CTB allocation failure and partial KLV registration, including failures
   before the new retain point. Audit shared state synchronization throughout.
4. Review all routed Apple callees, raw BAR access, force-wake variants,
   framebuffer/display paths, wait contexts and GuC parser length/type handling.
   A textual MMIO inventory is not a completed source or reachability review.
5. Verify GGTT mapping invalidation and LRCA lifetime through every error path.
6. Finish the full repository source/build review requested by the user.
   This document covers only the current protocol review, not all files.

## Validation limits

`git diff --check` passed during this batch. The initial syntax command lacked
kernel preprocessor definitions and incorrectly selected DriverKit declarations.
Adding `-DKERNEL=1 -DKERNEL_PRIVATE=1` makes Linux Clang syntax checking of
`kern_gen11.cpp` pass (23 warnings). This is not a full build; native macOS
build/link validation remains required. No VM boot, driver load, GPU submission
or Metal test was performed for this batch. The checkpoint is being submitted
to native macOS CI; build success must not be interpreted as runtime validation.

## Additional mailbox review

Compared `vfGucSendMMIO` with `gt/uc/intel_guc.c:intel_guc_send_mmio`.
The bridge previously retried after an ownership timeout or lost ownership
following BUSY. Working changes now replay only on explicit RETRY, validate
request origin/type, check the complete scratch mapping, initialize response
storage, and poison the mailbox after ambiguous ownership/BUSY timeouts.
Subsequent callers must not overwrite an outstanding request, including teardown.
The short existing BUSY deadline and interrupt-context callability still require
review. Lock publication now uses pointer compare-and-swap so concurrent first
callers cannot install distinct locks. A timeout poisons transport; it is not proof
that firmware stopped DMA.

VF identity evidence: i915 `gen12_pci_capability_is_vf()` reads `GEN12_VF_CAP_REG`
at `0x1901f8`, accepts only bit 0 and rejects other set bits. Identity must be
established independently of firmware handshake, with invalid MMIO distinguished
from a valid PF result. Implemented for the current transport; CPU-based
`isRealTGL` branches elsewhere are not a sufficient PF/VF discriminator.

## Software interrupt and bounded reader review

The Apple hardware callback at `0x2257e` only signals IOInterruptEventSource;
it does not advance the G2H head synchronously. Draining from the hardware
filter and checking head progress there was therefore incorrect. The VF filter
now dispatches once. A routed software callback drains up to 256 messages and
reschedules its event source when more remain. It preserves the CTBuffer
consumer's fence matching but ignores its legacy log-flush return bits, which
would otherwise misinterpret modern HXG actions (e.g. `0x1008`).

The VF reader validates fixed allocation bounds, descriptor status/indexes,
frame format and complete payload availability before copying into Apple's
32-dword stack buffer. Pending checks also validate the full descriptor instead
of treating corruption as an empty queue. The pure validation helpers passed
9,621,504 boundary cases plus malformed descriptors under ASan/UBSan. All 11
built C++ translation units passed syntax checking in `/tmp/ngreen-static.ZFW4Ro`.
These tests do not exercise DMA ordering, the actual copy, IRQ races or firmware.

Teardown remains a boot blocker: `IGHardwareGuC::free` (`0x206b8`) deregisters
CTB before unregistering hardware callbacks and removing its software event
source. The working shutdown flag now closes admission before disabling CTB,
waits out a current H2G writer under its queue lock, and leaves quarantined
addresses immutable. This fixes pointer-clearing races, not complete teardown.
`IGSharedMappedBuffer::free` (`0x10ae0`) and `unlockForCPUAccess` (`0x10b26`)
both clear the CPU mapping; object retention alone is not proof of mapping
lifetime. Caller reachability and synchronization are still under review.

## IRQ lifecycle audit

`IGInterruptBridge::enable` (`0x4a332`) and `disable` (`0x4a69a`) each
directly mask/unmask `GFX_MSTR_IRQ` (`0x190010`), outside the filter. Working
VF-only, symbol-bounded patches remove these four instructions while preserving
event-source operations and callback registration. Offline checks found exactly
one mask and one unmask instruction in each function. The adjacent
`enableInterrupts` (`0x4a42e`) and `disableInterrupts` (`0x4a778`) also write
GT enable/mask/selector/identity registers; routed VF replacements now
use the memory-IRQ enable vector, matching `intel_iov_memirq_postinstall/reset`.
PF routes retain the originals. Both non-multithreaded force-wake entry points
are routed to the VF no-op only for an identified VF.

Correction after inspecting `intel_uncore.c:vf_accessible_regs`: `0x190010`
and the GT IRQ register ranges ARE listed as VF-accessible. They must not be
described categorically as PF-only or as evidence of the host freeze. The
replacement rationale is the `HAS_MEMORY_IRQ_STATUS` branch in `i915_irq.c`,
whose VF handler/reset/postinstall use memory IRQs without those MMIO accesses.

Enable intent is recorded if requested before memory-IRQ allocation. This mask
does not stop GuC DMA or synchronize callbacks. Enable/configure/teardown races
and sleep/wake behavior remain to be completed. Latest offline syntax and ring
checks passed in `/tmp/ngreen-static.ETyDns`; these patches have not been loaded.

The relocation at `0x1fe47` resolves to `IOWorkLoop::workLoop`, confirming GuC
creates a separate workloop at object offset `0xa00`. This alone does not prove
that every synchronous lifecycle wait runs outside that workloop's gate.
State waits and TLB invalidation now explicitly reject a wait on that workloop
or while its gate is held. Other call-context and lock-order checks remain.

CT response dispatch now excludes BUSY, following `intel_guc_ct.c:ct_handle_hxg`;
BUSY is a mailbox transition, not a terminal CT fence completion. Retry remains
a terminal request outcome and must not be silently translated into success.

## Legacy sender containment and publication

Direct calls to `IGHardwareGuC::hostToGuCAction` (`0x21810`) issue `0x10`,
`0x20`, `0x30` and `0x3005`. They belong to the old doorbell/log/sampling path,
not the modern direct-LRCA submission implementation. The VF route now rejects
these untranslated requests rather than falling back to the old CT sender or
MMIO. The MMIO wrapper only translates CTB registration/deregistration; native
VF bootstrap/configuration calls use the modern helper directly. This is a
fail-closed boundary, not an implementation of those legacy features. The
upstream callers still need audit for physical accesses before issuing requests.

H2G pointer validation now checks the exact published descriptor/buffer layout
before dereferencing. Context table initialization is serialized by the shared
GuC mutex instead of publishing competing allocations. The queue rechecks
shutdown/fault admission under its own lock. All 11 syntax checks and ring tests
passed in `/tmp/ngreen-static.m8aWzd` after these changes.

`IGSharedMappedBuffer::unlockForCPUAccess` has no direct call sites in this
binary, but virtual/external reachability has not been ruled out.
`transferOwnership` (`0x2a318`) issues extended PCI configuration accesses at
`0xf8/0xfc` for each backing page when accelerator flag `0x20` is set; its VF
reachability and semantics need checking before retention can be called safe.

## Follow-up after the first CI checkpoint

- CTB allocation is tied to the initializing object and current thread, checks
  the native size/type/flags, and records the exact enlarged backing. Channel
  initialization rejects mismatches and live-ring reinitialization before any
  native layout writes. CPU mapping publication now follows descriptor setup.
- Quarantine now retains the CTB object as well as its backing: a preempted
  sender may hold a captured queue-lock pointer, so retaining backing alone
  cannot prevent a freed-lock access. Native `withOptions` failure and GuC free
  release the CTB object, so retention also defers its free/ownership-transfer
  path. This intentionally retains additional objects and accelerator state;
  it is NOT optimized teardown or support for restart/unload.
- CTB submission admission requires the firmware's enable acknowledgement;
  published mappings or partially registered KLVs are insufficient.
- The `createUkContext` route returns the native `0x400` failure sentinel if VF
  transport initialization failed, preventing the initialization fallback from
  creating legacy MMIO contexts. Native `initWithOptions` checks this sentinel
  at `0x1ff61`. Zero-context-count and other initialization exits still need review.
- Bootstrap RESET is one-shot: a concurrent caller or retry after incomplete
  initialization cannot reset firmware beneath partially initialized state.
- Removed the generic out-of-BAR INDEX2/DATA2 fallback from common MMIO access.
  Reads/writes now check alignment and subtraction-based bounds. Removed unused
  `readReg64/writeReg64` methods, which indexed a 32-bit pointer and truncated
  64-bit writes. No project call sites existed; prior code remains in git.
- The actual bounded ring copy now shares the tested helper. Added 1,277,856
  copy cases checking payload, head advancement, unchanged output on rejection
  and output canaries under ASan/UBSan, alongside 9,621,504 framing cases.
- Modern GuC memory-IRQ SW_INT_0 is a VF migration notification according to
  `intel_iov_memirq.c`, not Apple's legacy software interrupt bit 36. Migration
  currently faults/quarantines submission rather than dispatching the wrong
  handler. Migration recovery is not implemented.
- Clang static analyzer ran over all 11 built C++ units, logs in
  `/tmp/ngreen-analysis.PD6Iu7`. It reports possible null MMIO callbacks,
  DisplayMergeNub dictionary-copy leaks and dead stores. This is automated
  analysis, NOT completion of the requested full source/reachability review.
  The reported null callback path in `raWriteRegister32` now has an entry guard.

## Context submission/retirement audit (VM still stopped)

CI run 36215583625 for `aaf14a4` passed the macOS build and offline tests.
This is build evidence, not a successful acceleration baseline.

- Native `IGMappedBuffer::initWithOptions` stores the requested byte count at
  object offset `0x20` (`0x13b7d` saves the argument, `0x13c48` publishes it);
  `fillIfRequested` uses it as the fill bound. CTB initialization now checks
  that field against the enlarged backing before native channel writes.
  Context attach/submit similarly check the largest accessed register-image
  offset. These checks do not prove mapping ownership or concurrent unmapping.
- `IGHardwareContext::initWithOptions`, `0x7bfcd..0x7bfec`, derives descriptor
  LRCA directly from the image's GPU VA, without adding a page. Its register
  image is at CPU backing + `0x1000`. Attach now bounds the whole requested
  image length inside the VF GGTT window instead of checking only its first
  page. Actual page-table contents/ownership still need verification.
- i915 `intel_lrc.c:init_vf_irq_reg_state` is called by `__lrc_init_regs` for
  initial restore; the accompanying comment says later GPU saves recreate
  this state. Memory-IRQ command initialization has moved from every submit
  to the new-slot owner before REGISTER_CONTEXT. Repeated attach does not
  rewrite an active context image. Full per-engine layout validation remains.
- The old submit-state-check / CTB-enqueue gap allowed final detach to enqueue
  disable/deregister first. Submission now owns the pinned native H2G lock
  across admission, backing identity validation, tail write and enqueue.
  Final detach acquires the same lock before claiming retirement. Lock order
  is H2G -> context spinlock. Neither completion waits nor original detach
  run while holding H2G. The FAST sender accepts that exact already-held lock
  to avoid recursive acquisition. G2H lifecycle handling only takes the context
  spinlock and does not acquire H2G while holding it. Broader native-caller
  lock ordering, retry/backpressure and externally updated ring tails remain
  audit items; this is not a complete concurrency proof.
- Final detach claims the last reference exactly once. Attach rejects reference
  overflow or mismatched backing/descriptor/engine identity. Submission checks
  a live reference before image access. Native duplicate attach creates proxy
  bookkeeping, so successful duplicate attach/detach calls remain balanced.
- IRQ-context or interrupts-disabled callers cannot enter the new queue guard,
  FAST sender or synchronous GuC wait. Other mutex users and preemption-disabled
  call paths still require review. The VA getter at `0x10b60` simply reads
  backing + `0x38`; it does not acquire another lock.
- Pre-memory-IRQ submission now returns failure instead of reporting success
  without submitting. The old first-stamp workaround and caller failure paths
  must be reconciled before dynamic testing; this may deliberately expose an
  initialization failure previously hidden by fabricated progress.

The host-freeze cause remains unproven. VM boot, EFI installation, GPU work and
Sunshine configuration have not been attempted during this static audit.

## PCI capability gate and next transport finding

`9c705c2` passed macOS CI run 36216348082, including native kext link after
adding interrupt-context checks. No artifact from that revision was installed.

`kern_gpu_capabilities.hpp` records exact PCI IDs and `has_sriov` membership
from the local i915 tree's `include/drm/intel/pciids.h` and `i915_pci.c`.
Identification reads VF_CAP only for a known capable platform; known non-SR-IOV
platforms do not touch that Gen12 register; unknown/uninitialized IDs reject
identification without a speculative MMIO read. Device ID is captured at
`kern_green.cpp` PCI discovery before this project's configRead16/32 hooks.
The test compared all 65,536 IDs against independently expanded primary-source
macros (70 capable / 65 known non-capable). This does NOT establish acceleration
support for all those GPUs, nor remove the remaining CPU-model topology hacks.

Additional blocker found in `intel_guc_ct.c`: H2G availability is not sufficient
flow control. `ct_send_nb` also reserves G2H credits for asynchronous lifecycle
and TLB replies, leaving one quarter of G2H storage for unsolicited events.
The bridge currently bounds each copy and the H2G queue, but does not reserve
future G2H response space. This must be addressed before boot testing.
Completion lengths and enable-before-disable token ordering were compared with
`intel_guc_sched_done_process_msg` / `intel_guc_deregister_done_process_msg`:
Linux likewise requires at least two/one payload dwords and consumes pending
enable first; it does not interpret the second scheduling payload as status.

## G2H accounting and truthful completion follow-up

- Added atomic G2H reply-credit reservation before H2G publication: 4 dwords
  for MODE_DONE, 3 for DEREGISTER_DONE/TLB_DONE, matching i915's payload counts
  plus CT/HXG headers. Capacity is 3071 dwords, retaining the 4 KiB unsolicited
  reserve and empty/full sentinel in a 16 KiB receive ring. Timed-out operations
  keep their reservation; only matched completions return it. Duplicate TLB
  replies cannot refund twice. The supported fixed completion sizes are now
  exact, since larger unnegotiated replies invalidate the credit contract.
- Pure accounting tests exhaust 102,505 small-capacity combinations, check
  full production capacity, rejected over-refunds and UINT32 overflow under
  ASan/UBSan. These do not test real interrupts, firmware or DMA ordering.
  Credit release still occurs on the software workloop rather than Linux's
  receive tasklet; broader call-context/backpressure behavior remains under
  review. Send retries are bounded, not indefinite completion waits.
- Native CTB `hostToGuCAction` (`0x1f600`) has one direct caller, the GuC wrapper
  tail call at `0x21827`, already rejected by the VF route. This bridge sends
  FAST requests only. Response-type messages now halt instead of being fed to
  a nonexistent legacy waiter, particularly preventing FAST failure responses
  from leaving a context falsely treated as operational. Indirect reachability
  remains part of the full binary review.
- DEREGISTER_DONE keeps the LRCA associated with its retained tombstone until
  the retirement owner finishes native detach. Attach waits during that gap;
  only then can the ID/backing be reclaimed. Any protocol fault keeps backing
  quarantined even if a later event says deregistration completed.
- Removed the global V221 waitForStamp override and its startup flag. It used
  to change **any** pre-start wait error into success and fabricate outStamp,
  including for IOAccelerator clients other than the selected GPU. Native
  completion results now remain intact. This can expose the original startup
  sequencing failure; that failure must be fixed, not hidden. The VF startup
  wrapper also no longer registerService()s an accelerator whose start failed.

PCI-gate checkpoint `839de9d` passed native macOS CI run 36216611987. This later
credit/completion batch is still an offline safety change, not a boot candidate.
